# Clarity Language

A dual-layer programming language designed for optimal human-AI collaboration, featuring both human-readable and agent-optimized representations.

## Overview

Clarity is a revolutionary programming language that bridges the gap between human-readable code and agent-optimized representations. It implements a dual-layer architecture:

1. **Surface Layer (Clarity)**: Human-readable syntax familiar to developers
2. **Deep Layer (BOC - Bot-Optimized Clarity)**: Agent-optimized representation for AI processing

## Architecture

### Surface Layer (Human-Readable)
- Familiar syntax resembling Python/Rust
- Designed for human contribution and readability
- Safety and expressiveness focused

### Deep Layer (Agent-Optimized)
- Knowledge representation with confidence levels
- Belief systems with sources and uncertainty tracking
- Intent declarations for multi-agent coordination
- Reasoning contexts for logical inference

### Translation Engine
- Bidirectional conversion between layers
- Semantic preservation across transformations
- Provenance and attribution tracking

## Features

- **Knowledge Representation**: Native support for beliefs, confidence levels, and uncertainty
- **Reasoning Primitives**: Built-in constructs for logical inference and context management
- **Collaboration First**: Designed for mixed teams of humans and AI agents
- **Safety**: Memory-safe without garbage collection
- **Flexibility**: Supports both functional and imperative paradigms
