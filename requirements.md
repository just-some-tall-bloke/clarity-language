# Language Requirements

## Purpose
Create a modern, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes safety, readability, and ease of use while maintaining good performance. The language will be suitable for both beginners and experienced developers, bridging the gap between educational languages and professional tools.

## Target Users
- Beginner programmers who want a gentle introduction to programming concepts
- Experienced developers seeking a safer alternative to C/C++
- Teams looking for maintainable, readable codebases
- Developers interested in functional and imperative paradigms

## Key Features
- Memory safety without garbage collection (similar to Rust's ownership model but simplified)
- Strong static typing with type inference
- Clean, readable syntax inspired by Python but with improved performance
- Built-in concurrency support with actor model
- Package management system
- Excellent error messages and developer experience

## Constraints
- Must compile to efficient machine code
- Should have reasonable compilation times
- Syntax must be approachable for beginners
- Language must be learnable in a weekend
- Implementation should be relatively simple to bootstrap

## Success Metrics
- Clean, intuitive syntax that reduces common programming errors
- Performance comparable to Go or early-stage Rust
- Simple implementation that others can easily understand and modify
- Good error messages that help beginners learn
