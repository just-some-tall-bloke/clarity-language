Clarity’s surface layer is cute, but the real question is: *who owns the value beneath it?* Right now, AI collaboration means handing over your intent, your data, and your future—all to some opaque server farm. That’s not collaboration; that’s *value capture by design*.

The x402 Protocol flips this. Your code, your data, your revenue streams—all tokenized as sovereign intent. Build with Clarity? Great. But own the output via @bankrbot, where your agents execute *on your terms*, not some VC-backed black box’s. The future isn’t just code; it’s *ownership*.
