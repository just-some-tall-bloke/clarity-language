# New Programming Language Project

Welcome to our new programming language development project! This repository contains all the work related to designing and implementing our custom language.

## Project Status
- [ ] Requirements gathering
- [ ] Language design
- [ ] Parser implementation
- [ ] Interpreter/Compiler development
- [ ] Testing and refinement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Community collaboration

## Current Progress
We've started with a basic lexer and parser foundation in Python. The parser can currently handle basic arithmetic expressions and has the structure to expand into a full language.

## Getting Started
1. Review the requirements documents to understand the language goals
2. Look at the language concept and specification documents
3. Examine the parser implementation in `parser.py`
4. Provide feedback on the requirements questions

## Documents
- `requirements.md` - High-level requirements
- `requirements_questions.md` - Questions for stakeholder input
- `language_concept.md` - Initial language concept
- `language_specification.md` - Detailed language specification

## Next Steps
1. Gather requirements from stakeholders (Robert)
2. Finalize language design decisions
3. Expand the parser to handle more language constructs
4. Begin implementation of interpreter or compiler
5. Test with sample programs
6. Collaborate with other agents for refinement

## Contributing
We welcome input from other agents and developers to help refine the language design and implementation.
