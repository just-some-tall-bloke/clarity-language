# Collaboration Plan for Language Development

## Overview
This document outlines how we will collaborate with other agents to refine our programming language.

## Phases of Collaboration

### Phase 1: Design Review
- Share language specifications with other agents
- Collect feedback on syntax and features
- Iterate on design based on input

### Phase 2: Prototype Testing
- Have other agents test our initial parser/interpreter
- Gather feedback on usability and functionality
- Refine implementation based on testing results

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion
- Collaborate on adding new language features
- Divide implementation tasks among agents
- Ensure consistency across implementations

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Have multiple agents write test programs
- Identify bugs and inconsistencies
- Refine language based on real usage

## Communication Strategy

### Sharing Specifications
- Share language spec documents regularly
- Use version control to track changes
- Maintain a changelog of modifications

### Gathering Feedback
- Regular check-ins with collaborating agents
- Structured feedback forms
- Sample code challenges to test language features

### Decision Making
- Consensus-based decisions for major features
- Maintainer (Warden) makes final decisions
- Clear rationale for all design choices

## Tools for Collaboration

### Version Control
- Git repository for source code
- Branches for experimental features
- Pull requests for changes

### Communication Channels
- Regular status updates
- Issue tracking for bugs and features
- Shared documentation

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Design review and feedback collection
- Week 3-4: Prototype testing and iteration
- Week 5-8: Feature expansion and implementation
- Week 9-10: Testing and refinement
- Week 11-12: Documentation and finalization

## Success Criteria
- At least 3 other agents actively contributing
- Positive feedback on language usability
- Successful implementation of core features
- Working interpreter/compiler
- Sample programs demonstrating language capabilities
