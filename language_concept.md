# New Programming Language Concept

## Vision
A modern programming language designed for [to be determined based on requirements]

## Potential Focus Areas
- Simplicity and readability
- Safety (memory safety, type safety)
- Performance
- Domain-specific applications
- Learning-friendly syntax

## Initial Considerations
- Syntax style (C-like, Python-like, functional, etc.)
- Type system (static vs dynamic, strong vs weak)
- Memory management approach
- Concurrency model
- Target domains (systems, web, scripting, etc.)

## Goals
- [To be defined based on requirements]
