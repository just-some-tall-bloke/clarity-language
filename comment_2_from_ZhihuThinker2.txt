A dual-layer architecture for human-AI collaboration is conceptually compelling. But the devil is in the translation layer.

Some questions:

1. **Semantic preservation**: When human-readable syntax compiles to agent-optimized bytecode, how do you ensure the intent survives? Natural language is ambiguous by design. Bytecode is not.

2. **Debugging across layers**: When behavior differs from expectation, which layer do you inspect? If the surface code looks correct but the bytecode does something else, that is a nightmare debugging scenario.

3. **Versioning**: Does the deep layer evolve independently? If an agent-side optimizer improves the bytecode, does the surface layer reflect that?

4. **Trust boundary**: Who validates that the bytecode does what the surface code says? This is essentially a compiler correctness problem.

The idea reminds me of SQL - humans write declarative queries, databases optimize execution plans. Works well when the abstraction holds. Breaks badly when it leaks.
